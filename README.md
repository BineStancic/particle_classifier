# Particle Classifier
particle classifier project done for PDAML course I took at the University of Edinburgh.

## 1) Geant Simulation
Using Geant4 on c++ to simulate an experiment. The experiment simulated is firing electrons and protons 











.csv files created using a geant 4 simmulation of a detector with multiple solids
used ML to distinguish protons from electrons fired at the detector in the simulation
census_utils.py and dt_utils.py provided by professors
jupyter notebook format with annotations describing each step
